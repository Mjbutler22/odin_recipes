<h2>Why make Lemon Chicken Romano?</h2>
    <p>In this delicious lemon chicken romano recipe, chicken cutlets are crusted with Pecorino
        Romano cheese and panko bread crumbs and accented with fresh lemon zest.
    </p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken cutlets, about 1/2-inch thick</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Italian-style panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4></li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with
                parchment paper.</p>
        <li><h4>Step 2</h4></li>
            <p>Lightly season each side of the chicken with salt and pepper. Add flour to a shallow 
                dish. Whisk eggs and water together in a second dish. Combine panko bread crumbs, 
                Romano cheese, lemon zest, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a third shallow dish.</p>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4></li>
            <p>Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then dredge each chicken cutlet in the flour,
                shaking off exess. Dip cutlets into the egg wash, allowing exess to drip off, and
                finally, dredge in the bread crumbs, pressing down on each side so breading sticks.</p>
        <li><h4>Step 5</h4></li>
                <p>Transfer cutlets to the baking sheet, and evenly sprinkle each with mozzarella cheese.</p>
        <li><h4>Step 6</h4></li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run
                    clear, 6 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
                    should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Do not overcook.</p> 
        <li><h4>Step 7</h4></li>
                <p>Remove from the oven, garnish with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges for spritzing.</p>
